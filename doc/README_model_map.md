Session description:
--------------------

The perfect representation for data manipulation is based on collections, lists or maps but most applications are designed based on an object domain model. 

We solved this issue by implementing a KVM (Key Value Mapping) at the core level of our application. Data manipulation became very easy after implementing the bi-directional mapping of our entities to a key/value model. It took significant time before being able to leverage this new ecosystem and it started with a wide refactoring of the entities in order to fix our model key space. 

The main issues we faced were: 
* avoiding instance sharing (pointer equality is no longer available) 
* fixing the maximum size of the unbound relations 
* identifying the path from the root entities holder to every value 

We will explain: 
* the patterns to avoid 
* the mandatory refactorings 
* how we generated a key/value proxy API on top of our domain model (based on annotation processing and metadata). 

We implemented a wide set of new features on multiple tiers of our application and leveraged the power of stream API and RxJava. 

Here are a few examples: 

* mapping idempotence (consistency between Object entities and Key-Value model) 
* persistence in a column-based data store 
* diff between two instances of a domain model 
* incremental storage using CQRS, diff and Copy-On-Write approach of the model 
* optimized serialization using JSON dictionaries 
* easy mocking for testing 
* simplified MVC pattern for JS single page application 
* classifying datasets using Spark and MLLib directly on top of the domain model
