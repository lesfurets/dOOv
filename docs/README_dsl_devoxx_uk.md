# DSL.using(java).toGoBeyond(BeanValidation).at(Devoxx.eq(UK));

Fluent, stream-like API's are great for writing type checked code, taking
advantage of Java 8 functions and lambdas. But what about creating your own DSL
to manipulate and validate your model? We created an open-source framework
called dOOv (http://doov.io) that generates a validation DSL from a domain
model. This presentation will demonstrate the efficiency and expressiveness of
this framework to define validation constraints and to generate a human
readable and comprehensive rules catalog. The rules are represented as an
abstract syntax tree in dOOv, making it easy to add runtime information, debug
values and predicate evaluation optimisation. During the session, we will live
code legacy business rule migration to dOOv.
